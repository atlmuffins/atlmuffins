- 👋 Hi, I’m @atlmuffins
- 👀 I’m interested in putting layers in Spheroid Space and need help. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on putting somthing in a Space I own so other people can view it publicly through the app.
- 📫 How to reach me atlmuffins@yahoo.com


If I could get a tutorial on how to put a text later in "my specific space" on the spheroid network or putting any layer in the space.
